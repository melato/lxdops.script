  generate new host ssh keys, and save them in /etc/opt/etc/ssh, unless /etc/opt/etc/ssh already exists.
  This should be run when creating a new container from a template, so the container has its own ssh keys.

  body: |
    if [ ! -e /etc/opt/etc/ssh ]; then
      mkdir -p /etc/opt/etc/ssh
      rm -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host*
      service sshd restart
      cp /etc/ssh/ssh_host* /etc/opt/etc/ssh/
